Created a responsive user interface using Bootstrap for styling.
Integrated with a SQL Server database for data persistence.
Architecture:
Frontend: ASP.NET MVC Views and Controllers.
Backend: C# business logic and data access layer.
Database: SQL Server for data storage.
Containerization: Docker containers for deployment.
Orchestration: Utilized Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
Development Steps:
Established ASP.NET MVC project structure.
Implemented CRUD operations in controllers and views.
Configured ASP.NET Identity for user authentication.
Integrated with SQL Server for data persistence.
Dockerized the application using Dockerfile.
Set up Kubernetes cluster (locally using Minikube or on cloud providers like Azure Kubernetes Service).
Defined Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress) for deployment.
Deployed the application to Kubernetes cluster.
Deployment and Testing:
Built and pushed Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry).
Applied Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
Accessed the application via the exposed Ingress endpoint.
Conducted testing on CRUD operations, user authentication, and other features to ensure functionality.
